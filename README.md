**Formal Report: Design and Implementation of Dice Game Module**

**1. Introduction**

The "dice_game" module is designed to implement a simple state machine that simulates a dice game. It takes three input signals: clk (clock), reset_n (active low asynchronous reset), and ena (enable signal). The module provides a 3-bit output dice, which represents the current state of the dice game.

**2. Module Description**

The "dice_game" module consists of two always blocks. The first always block is sensitive to the positive edge of the clock (posedge clk) and the negative edge of the reset signal (negedge reset_n). The second always block is sensitive to any change in its input (always @(*)).

The state_reg and state_next registers hold the current and next states of the state machine, respectively. The initial state after reset is set to s1.

When ena is high, the state machine progresses through various states based on the current state (state_reg). The state transitions are as follows:
- s1 ➡ s6
- s2 ➡ s1
- s3 ➡ s5
- s4 ➡ s2
- s5 ➡ s4
- s6 ➡ s3

For any other state not listed above, the next state (state_next) remains the same as the current state (state_reg).

**3. Design Summary**

The design of the "dice_game" module is relatively straightforward, as it implements a simple state machine. The module operates in synchronous mode with respect to the clock and asynchronous mode with respect to the reset signal. The state transitions are determined by the value of the ena input signal.

**4. Simulation Results**

Before synthesizing the design, it is essential to perform functional simulations to verify the correctness of the state machine's behavior. The simulation should cover various scenarios, including normal operation and reset conditions. Additionally, the sensitivity to the ena signal should be verified.

**5. Synthesis and Implementation**

Once the design has been verified through simulations, the "dice_game" module can be synthesized and implemented on the target hardware. The design's synthesis report should be thoroughly checked for any critical warnings or timing violations.

**6. Conclusions**

The "dice_game" module has been successfully designed and implemented, providing a functional state machine to simulate a dice game. The design has been verified through simulations, ensuring its correct behavior under different scenarios.
